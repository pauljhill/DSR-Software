# Frontend Refactoring Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of the frontend refactoring effort. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and user experience without changing core functionality.

## Completed Tasks

### Components Refactoring
- [x] Extracted common table components
- [x] Created reusable form components
- [x] Improved dialog components
- [x] Enhanced loading indicators

### State Management
- [x] Implemented custom hooks for data fetching
- [x] Centralized error handling
- [x] Added loading states

### UI/UX Improvements
- [x] Consistent styling across components
- [x] Responsive design fixes
- [x] Accessibility improvements
- [x] Form validation enhancements

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] Memoized expensive components
- [x] Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- [x] Optimized CSV parsing

## In Progress

### Component Refactoring
- [ ] ShowForm component refactoring
- [ ] FileUpload component improvements

### State Management
- [ ] Refine CSV data management
- [ ] Improve equipment selection logic

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for hooks
- [ ] Add tests for utility functions

## Planned Tasks

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Standardize prop types
- [ ] Add better code documentation
- [ ] Fix minor console warnings

### Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Improve search functionality
- [ ] Add bulk operations support
- [ ] Enhance filtering capabilities

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Complex form state management
**Solution:** Created custom hooks to manage form state and validation, with clear separation of concerns.

### Challenge: Inconsistent error handling
**Solution:** Implemented centralized error handling with user-friendly messages.

### Challenge: CSV parsing performance
**Solution:** Added memoization for parsed data and optimized processing functions.

### Challenge: Different data formats across components
**Solution:** Created adapter functions to standardize data formats.

## Notes

### Technical Decisions
- Using functional components with hooks throughout
- Material-UI for consistent styling
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Axios for API requests

### Code Style Guidelines
- Component files: PascalCase
- Hook files: camelCase with use prefix
- Utility files: camelCase
- Line length max: 100 characters
- Use destructuring for props
- Use named exports for components

### Refactoring Principles
- Maintain backward compatibility
- One responsibility per component
- Minimize prop drilling
- Extract complex logic to hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Prioritize readability over cleverness
